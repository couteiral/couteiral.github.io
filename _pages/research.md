<p>My research concerns how to use artificial intelligence to engineer proteins. </p>

<p>As an interdisciplinary researcher, I have previously explored some other. Some of my previous work has explored how to use <a href="https://chemrxiv.org/engage/chemrxiv/article-details/60c73d91702a9beea7189bc2">generative AI to optimise molecular properties</a>, how <a href="https://wires.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/wcms.1481">quantum computing can be applied to drug discovery</a>, whether <a href="https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/38/7/1881/6517779">deep learning methods used to predict protein structures can also predict protein folding</a>, or how to <a href="https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2018/sc/c8sc01338a">model weak interactions in molecular systems</a>.</p>
