<p>My research concerns how to use artificial intelligence for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_engineering">protein engineering</a> â€” the design of protein variants with desirable properties. For example, in therapeutic discovery, after a promising antibody candidate has been found, it is often necessary to reduce immunogenicity, eliminate aggregation or increase plasma half-life while preserving binding affinity. These pursuits have traditionally been carried out <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_evolution">experimentally</a>, which has limited exploration to a small number of tested variants. In recent years, novel computational tools have arisen that can screen hundreds of thousands or millions of variants in short times.</p>

<p>My primary focus is in integrating biological perspectives into deep learning structures, a strategy to extract the maximum amount of value from the typically small datasets found in life sciences. I work closely with <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=QAdcBnQAAAAJ">Prof. Charlotte M. Deane</a> and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=y-nUzMwAAAAJ">Prof. Yee Whye Teh</a>.</p>

<p>Some topics of interest where I would welcome collaborations or scientific discussions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Protein stability and solubility engineering</li>
<li>Protein expression optimization</li>
<li>Scaffold and binder design</li>
<li>Enzyme design and optimization</li>
<li>Models of protein folding and dynamics</li>
</ul>

<p>As an interdisciplinary researcher, I have previously explored some other areas of work. Some of my previous work has explored how to use <a href="https://chemrxiv.org/engage/chemrxiv/article-details/60c73d91702a9beea7189bc2">generative AI to optimise molecular properties</a>, how <a href="https://wires.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/wcms.1481">quantum computing can be applied to drug discovery</a>, whether <a href="https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/38/7/1881/6517779">deep learning methods used to predict protein structures can also predict protein folding</a>, or how to <a href="https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2018/sc/c8sc01338a">model weak interactions in molecular systems</a>.</p>
