<p>Academic life doesn't offer many pleasures, but one of them is the privilege to organise lectures and tutorials, both at basic level and at the level of current research.</p>

<p>For the past years I have held a Stipendiary Lectureship in Physical and Structural Biochemistry at St Peter's College, University of Oxford. I have been invited to give invited lectures at graduate courses at the university (<i>e.g.</i> Data-Driven Approaches to Drug Discovery), summer schools (<i>e.g.</i> the International School of Crystallography, etc.) and business meetings (<i>e.g.</i> internal meetings at Novo Nordisk, the Life Sciences UK meeting organised by Pistoia Alliance, etc.). I am also an <a href="https://www.advance-he.ac.uk/fellowship/associate-fellowship">Associate Fellow of the Higher Education Academy</a>.</p>

<p>You can find some of the materials I produced for these events below:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="">Machine learning for protein structure: the past, the present and some of the future</a>, originally produced for the 58th International School in Crystallography <br>(last updated: March 2023)</li>
<li><a href="">Molecular orbital theory without tears</a></li>
</ul>
