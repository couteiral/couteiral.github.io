<p>One of the privileges of working in academia is that I get to teach lectures and talk about my work and the work of others in a regular basis. Owing to this I have spent quite a lot of my time talking about artificial intelligence and data science in biochemistry.</p>

<p>For the past years I have held a [Stipendiary Lectureship in Physical and Structural Biochemistry](https://www.spc.ox.ac.uk/people/carlos-outeiral) at St Peter's College, University of Oxford. I have been invited to teach at graduate courses at the university (<i>e.g.</i> Data-Driven Approaches to Drug Discovery courses at Centers for Doctoral Training, data science courses at MSc and undergraduate level), summer schools (<i>e.g.</i> the International School of Crystallography, etc.) and business meetings (<i>e.g.</i> internal meetings at Novo Nordisk, the Life Sciences UK meeting organised by Pistoia Alliance, etc.). I am also an <a href="https://www.advance-he.ac.uk/fellowship/associate-fellowship">Associate Fellow of the Higher Education Academy</a>.</p>

<p>You can find some of the materials I produced for these events below:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="/ai4proteins">Machine learning for protein structure: the past, the present and some of the future</a>, originally produced for the 58th International School in Crystallography <br>(last updated: March 2023)</li>
<li><a href="/osgdtraining">Introduction to data science</a>, originally produced for a 5-week course to train Oxford students to solve data science consultancy projects, organised by the society <a href="https://www.osgdigitallabs.com">Oxford Strategy Group Digital</a>.</li>
<li><a href="/motheory">Molecular orbital theory without tears</a>, originally produced as a handout for my tutorials in Physical Biochemistry at St Peter's College.</li>
