    <p>I am an <a href="https://www.schmidtfutures.com/our-work/schmidt-ai-in-science-postdocs/">Eric and Wendy Schmidt <i>AI in Science</i> research fellow</a> at the University of Oxford, where I also hold a secondment as Stipendiary Lecturer in Biochemistry. I am a computational biologist developing artificial intelligence tools to engineer proteins. I work closely with <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=QAdcBnQAAAAJ">Prof. Charlotte M. Deane</a> and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=y-nUzMwAAAAJ">Prof. Yee Whye Teh</a>, in the highly interdisciplinary environment of the Department of Statistics.</p>
    
    <p>Prior to joining the University of Oxford as a PhD student, I trained as a chemist at the universities of Oviedo (Spain) and Manchester (UK). I also enjoyed a brief stint developing generative AI methods for small molecule drug discovery at the lab of <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Ag_6KEgAAAAJ">Prof. Al√°n Aspuru-Guzik</a>, back then at Harvard University (US), which first showed me the opportunities of combining cutting-edge machine learning algorithms with a chemical background and good understanding of biology.</p>

    <p>I have a variety of interests that span protein engineering and protein design, language models, drug discovery, point-cloud based deep learning, enzymology, and related. To read more about my research interests and contributions, check out my <a href="/research">Research page</a>. In this page, I write about the latest developments in biotech and TechBio, and my opinions on the future of the field. Some of my passions outside of science are molecular cuisine, social dancing and strength conditioning, and I occasionally write about these as well.</p>
